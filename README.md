Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to create code that could count and display the information inside of a storage file, to make keeping track of inventory easier
What did you do particularly well?
I really like the histogram, I feel like the lines to count make it visually appealing.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
If I had more time I could add an input to add new items to the storage file, or add more of existing items.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The histogram was the most challenging part, the formatting kept giving me trouble, I just worked at it until it got it right.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Problem solving will be my takeaway skill from this, alot of issues I had were easier to fix than I made them out to be.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By seperating most of my options, I created a clean main file to pull from them.
